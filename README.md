It's a fork of https://github.com/AngelJumbo/gruvbox-wallpapers
I like the collection but the repository weight is too big even with depth=1. So I leave only 'irl' folder and remove the rest. Thank you AngleJumbo for the repository.

This repository is synced daily with the original repository.

I tend to accept any contributions, but let's keep the site with images that match or look good with the gruvbox's color scheme :').
